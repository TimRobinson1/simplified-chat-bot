Simplified Chat Bot
==============

This simplified chat interface was built in Ruby, using Ruby on Rails, as part of a tech test.
The user is presented with options to choose from and picks one to send. Once sent,
the bot begins to create a response, and once that's through the user can respond once more.
Soon, the chatroom will determine whether you have socialised successfully, or if you've
failed to impress.

Once signed up, you can change around how the bot responds to you and what sentences
you can provide it, customising the conversation and outcomes to your choosing.
